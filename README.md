# Raspberry-Pi-Handheld-Computer-Case
Raspberry Pi Handheld Computer Case w/ UPS, inc. Ports

A Raspberry Pi case made as a portable for my radio hobby. It can be held in one hand with the trackbaÄºl mouse operated with thumb or index finger (depending on orientation). Openscad file included for customisation. Pi and UPS models also created to aid cutout positioning, as well as model slicer views. Had a lot of fun making it.
